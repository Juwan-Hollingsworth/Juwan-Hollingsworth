## HeyðŸ‘‹ thanks for stopping by,

### I'm Juwan, a technical engineer II by day, software engineer by night. With 5+ years of experience, I specialize in web app development, performance optimization, and RESTful/SOAP APIs.
My tech stack includes Java, Python, and JavaScript, with a knack for troubleshooting, full-stack development and cloud solutions.
When I'm not diving into code or deploying scalable applications, you'll find me analyzing stock market trends, lifting wieghts, 
or cheering on the Ravens. Football, fitness, and finances â€“ that's my off-duty trinity. Let's connect! ###
