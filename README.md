### Hi there 👋

I'm Juwan, a senior Computer Science major at Clayton State University here in Atlanta, GA 👨🏾‍💻 I have over two years of hands-on experience in software engineering, both professional and recreational. I have a passion for developing high-quality applications that can be applied to the real world and coding things that make life convenient. I also have strong technical skills in programming. Some langauges/concepts I'm familiar with include Python, Javascript, PHP, React, Node.js, and C++ to name a few  I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to further broaden my horizon 😁
